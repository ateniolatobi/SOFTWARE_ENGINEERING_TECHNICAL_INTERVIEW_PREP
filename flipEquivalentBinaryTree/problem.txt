For a binary tree T, we can define a flip operation as follows: choose any node, and swap the left and right child subtrees.

A binary tree X is flip equivalent to a binary tree Y if and only if we can make X equal to Y after some number of flip operations.

Given the roots of two binary trees root1 and root2, return true if the two trees are flip equivelent or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Flipped Trees Diagram
Input: root1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8], root2 = [1,3,2,null,6,4,5,null,null,null,null,8,7]
Output: true
Explanation: We flipped at nodes with values 1, 3, and 5.
Example 2:

Input: root1 = [], root2 = []
Output: true
Example 3:

Input: root1 = [], root2 = [1]
Output: false
Example 4:

Input: root1 = [0,null,1], root2 = []
Output: false
Example 5:

Input: root1 = [0,null,1], root2 = [0,1]
Output: true
