Given an integer array nums, find the sum of the elements between indices i and j (i ≤ j), inclusive.

Example:

Given nums = [-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1]

sumRange(0, 2) -> 1
sumRange(2, 5) -> -1
sumRange(0, 5) -> -3
 

Constraints:

You may assume that the array does not change.
There are many calls to sumRange function.
0 <= nums.length <= 10^4
-10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
0 <= i <= j < nums.length
